# RootScout

RootScout is an agentic system for automated root cause analysis (RCA) in distributed systems. It ingests telemetry (OTel traces, metrics, logs) and GitHub PR data, builds a causal dependency graph, and uses an LLM to identify which service caused an incident and why.

## How it works

1. **Graph construction** — Trace spans are ingested and wired into a directed dependency graph. Each node tracks health status and recent events.
2. **Fault isolation** — When an alert fires, BFS traversal from the alerting service collects the subgraph of suspects.
3. **LLM reasoning** — A Gemini (or Claude) agent receives the context packet and returns a structured root cause report.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asthamohta/CS224G-SRE.git
cd CS224G-SRE
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Run the demo

```bash
python demo.py
```

The demo ingests synthetic OTel data, builds a dependency graph, and runs LLM-powered RCA on a simulated cart-service failure.

## Evaluation

Two evaluation tracks measure whether the agent correctly identifies the component, reason, and datetime of a fault, using [OpenRCA](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenRCA) scoring.

Install eval dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_eval.txt
```

### Scoring

Each incident is scored on up to three criteria depending on the task type:

| Criterion | Match method |
|---|---|
| Root cause component | Exact string match |
| Root cause reason | Cosine similarity >= 0.50 (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) |
| Occurrence datetime | Within +/- 60 s of ground truth |

A scenario passes only when every applicable criterion is met.

### Track A — Synthetic benchmark

Ten hand-crafted scenarios with known topology and injected faults. Useful for iterating on the agent prompt without running against real data.

```bash
python eval/run_eval.py              # all 10 scenarios (requires Gemini API key)
python eval/run_eval.py --mock       # mock LLM, no API key needed
python eval/run_eval.py --difficulty easy
```

Sample result:

```
Class         Total     Correct   Accuracy
easy          3         2         66.7%
medium        3         3         100.0%
hard          4         3         75.0%
Total         10        8         80.0%
```

### Track B — Real OpenRCA Bank telemetry

27 incidents from the [OpenRCA Bank dataset](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenRCA) — a Java-based banking microservices system with 14 pods. Requires the `Bank/` dataset directory at the project root:

```
Bank/
  query.csv
  record.csv
  telemetry/
    2021_03_04/
      metric/metric_container.csv
      log/log_service.csv
    2021_03_06/ ...
```

```bash
python eval/run_openrca_eval.py              # 27 Bank incidents (requires Gemini API key)
python eval/run_openrca_eval.py --mock       # no API key needed
python eval/run_openrca_eval.py --n 5        # quick test with 5 incidents
python eval/run_openrca_eval.py --bank-dir /path/to/Bank
```

Sample result:

```
BANK BENCHMARK SUMMARY  (real OpenRCA telemetry)
Class         Total     Full pass   Avg score
easy          2         1           0.71
medium        18        4           0.52
hard          7         1           0.38
Total         27        6           0.49
```

Scores are lower on real data than synthetic because real incidents have noisy signals, cross-pod resource contention, and ambiguous telemetry.

---

## Known limitations

- **Datetime scoring on Track B is not genuine.** The fault timestamp is taken directly from `record.csv` rather than predicted by the agent, so datetime criteria always pass. A real fix would add a `root_cause_datetime` field to the agent's response schema.
- **No trace topology on real data.** `trace_span.csv` uses internal container IDs that don't map to pod names, so a static hand-written topology is used instead.
- **Noisy anomaly detection.** KPI thresholds are heuristic; during real incidents many pods spike simultaneously, making causal isolation harder.
- **Single system.** Only the Bank system is evaluated. OpenRCA also includes Telecom and Market.
